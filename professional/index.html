        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Corey Beaver, a software engineering student at Oakland Community
          College. I've always been passionate about coding, and I find joy in
          seeing my imagination come to life with every line of code. During the
          coronavirus lockdown, I began coding more seriously, which led me to
          explore different programming languages and delve deeper into software
          development. My journey with coding started as early as 5th grade when
          I used Scratch, and since then, I've been continuously honing my
          skills. Recently, I was part of a small indie game dev group
          that participated in two separate game jams, resulting in the creation
          of two unique games which can be found below. My long-term aspiration is to become the best
          developer that I can possibly be, with a heavy focus on game
          development. I specialize in gameplay programming and hold
          certifications as a Unity Certified User: Programmer and Unity
          Certified User: Artist. I am also have both my CIW: Advanced HTML5 and
          CSS3 Specialist and my Java Foundations Certified Junior Associate
          Certification.
