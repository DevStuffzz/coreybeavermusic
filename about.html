        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Corey Beaver. I am 19 years old, and from Detroit. I go to Ascend Church in Troy, Mi,
            where I serve on the Worship Team as a keys player, and I am on the Youth Leadership team.
            </br>
            </br>

            I've studied music since I was in 5th grade. I did Marching Band from 7th grade all the way through my
            Senior Year, where I was the Drum Major. After High School, I did a semester of Worship
            Studies at Indiana Bible College.

        <h3>Beliefs</h3>
        <p>
        
            1. Repentance 
            <br>
            Romans 3:23 says "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;".
            Because we all mess up, and nobody is perfect but the living God, I believe
            that we must live our lives in repentance and turn away from our past, and God
            will make us a new creation in him. 
            <br><br>
            2. Baptism by water
            <br>
            Baptism is a required part of salvation (John 3:5, Mark 16:16), and must be done ONLY
            in the name of Jesus (Mathew 28:19, Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, 19:5).
            A true baptism must be of ones own free will and understanding, and
            must go fully submerged to be completly burried with Christ.
            <br><br>
            3. Baptism by spirit
            <br>
            Both Baptism by water and by spirit are essential pieces to salvation. (John 3:5)
            The biggest sign that one is filled with the Holy Ghost is speaking in tounges
            <br><br>
            4. Tounges
            <br>
            The bible gives a clear distinction between two types of tounges.
            The first tounge edifies the congregation, in which an enterpreter is used to give
            give a message from Jesus. The second one is tounges as a prayer language, which edifies
            yourself spiritually. This tounge can be spoken in a known or an unknown language. Ones tounge
            must be given to them from God, and not a learned thing.
            <br><br>
            5. Oneness
            <br>
            I believe in the one true God. We use the title Father to describe God, the 
            title Son to describe the flesh of Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit to describe
            the wonders that take place. There is only one name given to us, in which we
            are saved. (Acts 4:12, Ephesians 4:5-6)
